.. CyTRACK documentation 

Welcome to CyTRACK's documentation!
=================================

Welcome to the documentation of the CyTRACK code. CyTRACK can be used to tracking cyclones (e.g., tropical, extratropical, subtropical, tropical-like) in different basins of the world


CyTRACK is written in Python and is most easy to use as a command line tool with configuration script that can be edited in your favorite editor.


We highly recommended to read the CyTRACK `paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2024.106027>`_ to understand the cyclone tracking algorithm and its parameters (:ref:`citation`).
